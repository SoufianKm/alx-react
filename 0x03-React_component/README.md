## Introduction
This project explores various aspects of React components, including functional and class-based components, component lifecycle, testing with Jest and Enzyme, and performance optimization. It also covers advanced topics like Higher Order Components (HOCs) and Pure components.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand when to use a Class or a function to create a React component.
- Learn about the lifecycle of a Class component and how to manage it.
- Gain skills in testing components using Jest and Enzyme.
- Utilize Jest spies to verify that functions are being called correctly.
- Understand what Higher Order Components (HOCs) are and how to implement them.
- Learn techniques for optimizing performance and controlling which components render.

## Components
This project includes various examples of React components, demonstrating the use of functional components, class components, Pure components, and HOCs.

## Testing
Testing is done using Jest and Enzyme. Tests include:
- Unit tests for functional and class components.
- Snapshot tests for component rendering.
- Use of Jest mock functions and spies to verify function calls.

To run tests, use:

```sh
npm test
```

## Performance Optimization
The project explores techniques for optimizing React component performance, including the use of `React.PureComponent` and memoization. It also discusses when to use these optimizations and their impact on the application.

## Higher Order Components (HOCs)
HOCs are an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. This project includes examples and explanations of how to create and use HOCs effectively.

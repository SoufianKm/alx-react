# React Immutable

## Overview

This repository focuses on integrating immutability into React applications using Immutable.js. Immutable data structures can significantly enhance the predictability and performance of your application by preventing accidental data mutations.

## Resources

To get a solid understanding and background on immutable data structures and Immutable.js, consider the following resources:

- **Immutable Object Concept**: Understanding the foundational concepts of immutability and its benefits in programming.
- **[Immutable.js Documentation](https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/)**: The official documentation for Immutable.js, providing a comprehensive guide to its API and usage.
- **[Immutable.js GitHub Repository](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js)**: The source code and additional resources for Immutable.js.

## Learning Objectives

By engaging with this repository, you will:

1. **Understand Immutable Objects**:
   - **Who**: Discover who can benefit from immutable objects.
   - **What**: Learn what immutable objects are and how they differ from mutable objects.
   - **When**: Determine when to use immutable objects in your applications.
   - **Where**: Explore where immutable objects fit within different programming paradigms.
   - **Why**: Understand the advantages of using immutable objects, including improved predictability and easier state management.

2. **Utilize Immutable.js**:
   - Learn how to incorporate the Immutable.js library into your JavaScript projects to bring immutability to your data structures.

3. **Differentiate Between List and Map**:
   - Understand the differences between Immutable.js `List` and `Map` collections, and when to use each.

4. **Leverage Merge, Concat, and Deep Merging**:
   - Learn how to use Immutable.js methods such as `merge`, `concat`, and deep merging techniques to manipulate and combine immutable data structures.

5. **Understand Lazy Sequences**:
   - Explore what lazy sequences (`Seq`) are, and how they can be used to improve performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**:
   - Install Immutable.js via npm: `npm install immutable`.

2. **Basic Usage**:
   - Import the library and start using immutable collections:
     ```javascript
     import { Map, List } from 'immutable';

     const map = Map({ key: 'value' });
     const list = List([1, 2, 3]);
     ```

3. **Examples**:
   - Explore examples of using `merge`, `concat`, and lazy sequences in the examples directory.

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use React props to build dynamic and reusable components. It covers creating basic React components, reusing components, passing properties to components, defining types, using fragments, and improving performance with keys in loops.

## Features
- Create basic React components using functions
- Reuse components efficiently
- Pass properties (props) to components
- Define types for components using PropTypes or TypeScript
- Use React Fragments to group multiple elements
- Optimize loops with keys for better performance
